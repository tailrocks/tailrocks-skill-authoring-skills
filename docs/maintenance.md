# Maintenance

## Verify commands

Run each command from the repository root. Every command must exit 0.

Structure check:

```sh
alint check
```

Expected result: no errors. The check enforces required paths,
manifest agreement, README sections, skill-id shape, and the ban on
component catalogs.

Strict-JSON check. It rejects comments, trailing commas, and
duplicate keys in the three manifests:

```sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json
FILES = ["plugin.json", ".claude-plugin/plugin.json", ".kimi-plugin/plugin.json"]
def hook(pairs):
    seen = set()
    for key, _ in pairs:
        if key in seen:
            raise ValueError("duplicate key: " + key)
        seen.add(key)
    return dict(pairs)
for path in FILES:
    with open(path) as handle:
        json.load(handle, object_pairs_hook=hook)
    print("OK " + path)
EOF
```

Expected result: one `OK` line per manifest.

Frontmatter and ID check. It verifies the frontmatter block, the
name key, name and directory agreement, id charset, and the
description key for each skill:

```sh
python3 - <<'EOF'
import glob, os, re, sys
found = sorted(glob.glob("skills/*/SKILL.md"))
errors = []
for path in found:
    skill_id = path.split(os.sep)[1]
    text = open(path).read()
    match = re.match(r"---\n(.*?)\n---\n", text, re.S)
    if not match:
        errors.append(path + ": missing frontmatter block")
        continue
    front = match.group(1)
    name = re.search(r"^name:\s*(\S+)\s*$", front, re.M)
    if not name:
        errors.append(path + ": missing name key")
        continue
    if name.group(1) != skill_id:
        errors.append(path + ": name does not match directory")
    if not re.fullmatch(r"[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*", name.group(1)):
        errors.append(path + ": invalid skill id")
    if not re.search(r"^description:", front, re.M):
        errors.append(path + ": missing description key")
if errors:
    print("\n".join(errors))
    sys.exit(1)
print("OK %d skills: names match, ids valid, descriptions present"
      % len(found))
EOF
```

Expected result: `OK 4 skills` plus the verified-facts summary.

Markdown check:

```sh
npx --yes markdownlint-cli2@0.23.3 "**/*.md" "!**/.github/**"
```

Expected result: no issues. The command pins the version. There is
no shared markdownlint config yet, so the check uses default rules.
The exclusion skips Velnor-generated `.github/` files: nobody may
hand-edit them, so their long lines are not package findings. The
glob covers `**/*.md` only. It also skips the `.template` files:
their angle-bracket placeholders are not HTML.

Native validator probes (read-only, no install):

```sh
claude plugin validate ./
muse plugins validate ./ --json
muse skills validate ./skills/tailrocks-skill-audit
```

Expected result, observed 2026-10-07: `claude plugin validate`
passes with one author warning (the host manifest carries name,
version, and description only, per the common structure).
`muse plugins validate` reports `valid: true`. It finds all four
skills through the portable root manifest. It lists warnings only:
an inactive `.claude-plugin` overlay description beside the
authoritative root, and the generated `.github/CLAUDE.md` symlink.
`muse skills validate` reports valid. A probe result never replaces
the installation checks in `compatibility.md`.

Known tension: `claude plugin validate --strict` exits 1 because it
promotes the author warning to an error. Plain validation passes,
so the package installs. Do not add `author` to the host manifest
as a local fix: that would break the common structure. Resolve the
tension in the common design instead.

Generation diff. It proves `.github/` matches the generator output:

```sh
velnor-actions generate --output-dir /private/tmp/velnor-preview
diff -r --brief .github /private/tmp/velnor-preview/.github
```

Expected result: empty diff. The generator preserves
`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. See the CI source section below.

## Policy version and update

- alint: v0.17.0.
- Shared profile: `standards/alint/active.yml` at
  tailrocks-skills commit
  `d54adec8f3188962cdd2b8298350d24114b87079`.
- Pin:
  `sha256-80c782b168658bbfb10aa01f43712435ef20313f5af22ffaddd6b08256b22616`.
- markdownlint-cli2: 0.23.3.

Bump the pin in one pull request. Update the REV and HASH together
in `.alint.yml`. Regenerate. Then re-run every verify command.

## CI source and regeneration

`.velnor/config.toml` is the source. `velnor-actions generate` writes
`.github/` from it. Never hand-edit `.github/` as the fix for a
workflow problem. Change the config. Regenerate.

The 0.1.0 generator (velnor-new commit `47c7b5b2e`) preserves the
hand-placed `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. A regenerate keeps
the file unchanged. Do not restore the file after a regenerate.

The generated CI also compares `.github/` against a fresh generate.
The observed comparison is empty. Keep the template: the shared
alint profile requires it.

## Release and migration

Release in this order:

1. Tag the release commit.
2. Resolve the exact commit SHA of the tag.
3. Bump the `rev` of this plugin in the central catalog at
   `tailrocks/tailrocks-skills`.
4. Regenerate the native catalogs from the central source.
5. Re-run every verify command.
6. Publish the tag.

Migrate installs per the agent procedures in `installation.md`.
Uninstall each plugin per scope. Remove the old marketplace. Add the
new marketplace. Install the plugin. The order prevents
duplicates.

## Prohibited evaluation content

Never add evaluation content to skills, references, templates, task
definitions, or CI. This ban covers these activities:

- Behavioral benchmarks
- Trigger precision and recall
- Repeated model trials
- Scored wording comparisons
- Model-family matrices
- Pressure scenarios
- Holdout datasets
- Judge or grader models
- Pass-rate targets
- Token and latency comparisons
- Mandatory failing baselines
- Task trials under any name.

Do not relabel such work as smoke, pressure, or compatibility
checks. A sample task never proves behavior.

Before aggregate commands, read each task definition. Strip
evaluation steps. Never trust the command name. To find violations,
search case-insensitively for `benchmark`, `trigger precision`,
`trigger recall`, `model trial`, `scored output`, `model-family`,
`pressure scenario`, `holdout`, `judge`, `grader`, `pass-rate`, and
`task trial`. Before a change, read the surrounding text. A
prohibition or a historical explanation is not an active
requirement.
