# Compatibility

This record covers each client and route. The default outcome is
unverified. Each unverified row names its reason. A route is never
unsupported only because its binary is absent. A route is never
verified only because a different client accepted the same files.

No installation check ran in this rewrite. Each row stays open
until its required evidence exists.

## Manual-only enforcement

This table records documented support, not runtime verification.
Enforced means the client blocks automatic model invocation of the
four manual-only skills. Limited means the client documents the
frontmatter but cannot enforce it.

| Client | Four-skill entry |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Enforced (`disable-model-invocation`). |
| Codex | Enforced (`allow_implicit_invocation: false`). |
| Kimi Code | Enforced (`disableModelInvocation`). |
| Grok Build | Enforced (`disable-model-invocation`). |
| Amp | Limited: lists every skill to the model. |
| Antigravity | Limited: frontmatter holds `name` and `description` only. |
| Muse Code | Limited: recall observer can surface skills. |
| OpenCode V1 | Gated by `permission.skill: ask`. |

## Static fit

This list reflects the package files on 2026-10-07. It is not an
install proof:

- All four frontmatter names match their skill directories.
- All names are 24 characters or less. All descriptions are 262
  characters or less. The Amp, OpenCode, and Kimi caps fit.
- The root manifest carries the Agent Plugins 1.0.0 schema id.
- The Kimi manifest sets `skills` to `./skills/`.
- Every payload file under `skills/` is text. No file carries the
  executable bit.
- The stored template uses the `.template` form. No discoverable
  `SKILL.md` sits inside template assets.
